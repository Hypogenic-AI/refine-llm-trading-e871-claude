  title: Refining LLM Trading
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Large language model agents may perform better in financial trading
    when making longer-term trading decisions, as opposed to optimizing for short-term,
    day-to-day profit.

    '
  background:
    description: Current attempts to make LLM agents for finance tend to optimize
      short term profit by making day-to-day trading decisions. Would LLM's perform
      better making longer-term trading decisions?
