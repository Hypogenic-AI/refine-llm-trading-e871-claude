Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks by leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, these approaches are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT typically requires rapid, risk-aware decisions driven by structured, short-horizon signals, such as technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend features. These signals stand in sharp contrast to the long-horizon, text-driven reasoning that characterizes most existing LLM-based systems in finance. To bridge this gap, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents--Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk--each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. Extensive experiments across nine financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, demonstrate that QuantAgent consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher predictive accuracy at both 1-hour and 4-hour trading intervals across multiple evaluation metrics. Our findings suggest that coupling structured trading signals with LLM-based reasoning provides a viable path for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.", "citations": 5}

Inputs to the model are narrative text from 10-K reports of large market capitalization companies in the S&P 500 index; the output is a forward-looking buy or sell decision. Price direction is predicted at discrete horizons up to 12 months after the report filing date. The results reported here demonstrate good out-of-sample statistical performance (F1-macro= 0.62) at medium to long investment horizons. In particular, the buy signals generated from 10-K text are found most precise at 6 and 9 months in the future. As measured by the F1 score, the buy signal provides between 4.8 and 9 percent improvement against a random stock selection model. In contrast, sell signals generated by the models do not perform well. This may be attributed to the highly imbalanced out-of-sample data, or perhaps due to management drafting annual reports with a bias toward positive language.

The rapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity stock rating process. This paper explores the application of LLMs to predict stock performance and generate stock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods rely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several challenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed reactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs to improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the financial domain. We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news data from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a training cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show that our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when assessed by forward returns. Specifically, incorporating financial fundamentals enhances ratings accuracy. While integrating news data improves short-term performance, substituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use without loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely enhances performance by reducing bias. Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large amounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at the stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible framework for generating consistent and accurate stock ratings, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend the analysis to longer time horizons, incorporating more diverse data, and utilizing newer models to enhance detailed investment analysis and reports.", "citations": 12}

We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses.

However, most existing trading agents operate under intraday, independent unit-based trading tasks, where decisions are made as isolated directional actions, and thus lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we propose FinPos, a position-aware trading agent system designed to explicitly model and manage continuous positions. FinPos enhances position awareness through three key mechanisms: (1) professional-level interpretation of heterogeneous market information; (2) a dual-agent decision structure that separates directional reasoning from risk-aware position adjustment; and (3) multi-timescale reward signals, allowing the agent to internalize position awareness through experiential feedback rather than static instructions alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.", "citations": 2}

The efficacy of GPTs lies in their ability to decode human instructions, achieved through comprehensively processing historical inputs as an entirety within their memory system. Yet, the memory processing of GPTs does not precisely emulate the hierarchical nature of human memory. This can result in LLMs struggling to prioritize immediate and critical tasks efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative LLM multi-agent framework endowed with layered memories. We assert that this framework is well-suited for stock and fund trading, where the extraction of highly relevant insights from hierarchical financial data is imperative to inform trading decisions. Within this framework, one agent organizes memory into three distinct layers, each governed by a custom decay mechanism, aligning more closely with human cognitive processes. Agents can also engage in inter-agent debate. In financial trading contexts, LLMs serve as the decision core for trading agents, leveraging their layered memory system to integrate multi-source historical actions and market insights. This equips them to navigate financial changes, formulate strategies, and debate with peer agents about investment decisions. Another standout feature of our approach is to equip agents with individualized trading traits, enhancing memory diversity and decision robustness. These sophisticated designs boost the system's responsiveness to historical trades and real-time market signals, ensuring superior automated trading accuracy.", "citations": 85}

We propose a novel framework consisting of two components to surmount these challenges. The first component, the Local-Global (LG) model, introduces three distinct strategies for modeling global information. These approaches are grounded respectively on stock features, the capabilities of LLMs, and a hybrid method combining the two paradigms. The second component, Self-Correlated Reinforcement Learning (SCRL), focuses on aligning the embeddings of financial news generated by LLMs with stock features within the same semantic space.

To address these limitations, we propose MM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on large language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception from strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language model (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart patterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights; (2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout, positioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3) proposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the router's market classification capability and experts'risk-adjusted decision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks, futures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly outperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep reinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.

Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies.

We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025). Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency. This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent.

To address these issues, we proposed a sector rotation portfolio management approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) via multi-source information. The multi-source information includes the temporal data of sector and stock features, as well as news data. In terms of structure, in this method, a dual-layer reinforcement learning structure is deployed, comprising a multi-agent sector layer and a graph convolution layer. The former learns the trend of sectors, while the latter learns the connections between stocks in sectors, and the impact of news on sectors is integrated through large language models without manual labeling or fusing output information of other modules to provide the final portfolio management scheme.

This paper presents a data-driven guide to the forum that started the hype -- WallStreetBets (WSB). Our initial experiments decompose the forum using a large language topic model and network tools.

This paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The resulting\"barbell\"structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary redundancy in trend premia.", "citations": 0}

In the paper, several novel measures of trading activity at different investment horizons are introduced through the scaling of variance of the underlying processes.

In our approach, financial markets are viewed as complex adaptive systems, and multiscale properties and cross-correlations are considered, particularly during stress conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022, and Brexit. We investigate whether significant disruptions reflect an imbalance in investment horizons among investors, and we propose a measure based on this imbalance to depict the impact on global financial markets. The detrended cross-correlation cost (DCCC), which is derived from detrended cross-correlation analysis, uses cross-correlations at different timescales to capture variations in investment horizons amid financial uncertainties. Our algorithm, which combines DCCC analysis and the minimum-spanning-tree filtering approach, tracks system interconnectedness and investor imbalances. We tested the DCCC indicator using daily price series of G7, Russian, and Chinese markets over the past decade and found that it increases sharply during ``crash'' periods compared to ``business as usual'' periods. Our empirical results confirm that short-term investment horizons dominate during financial instabilities; this validates our hypothesis and indicates that the DCCC can serve as a leading indicator of shifts in financial-market regimes.", "citations": 0}

Diverging from prevalent short-term, often next-day prediction research, it recognizes the need for adaptable predictive models in dynamic market conditions. Our approach employs a diverse array of sub-models, each comprising various traditional and novel input features, systematically paired with machine learning techniques like ANN and SVM. These features are processed in parallel to optimize configurations for different market phases. A key innovation is the development of new relative indicators and trend forecast indicators, derived from methods like SMA, EMA, LOWESS, and linear regression. Utilizing rolling windows and techniques like exponential smoothing, we project trends 70 trading days ahead, enhancing our models\u2019 ability to predict significant market movements.

For this purpose, we consider an equilibrium model with investors exhibiting an empirically well-justifiable decreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA) and different investment horizons. In contrast to the seminal CAPM, two fund separation does no longer hold, and investors not only regard one risk measure such as the standard deviation but additionally care for the size of tail risk. The shorter the investment period, the more prone they are to negatively skewed returns. In particular, short-term investors not only hold a lower equity ratio than (else equal) long-term investors do, but they also reduce the fraction of assets with negative tail risk. Consistently, the more short-term investors are in a market, the higher the tail risk premium is, i.e., the additional expected return due to skewness beyond a given standard deviation. Consequently, these theoretical findings allow us to draw empirical predictions about (i) the drivers of the skewness premium, (ii) characteristics for markets in which the premium is especially severe, and (iii) the optimal investors\u2019 asset allocation.", "citations": 1}

Using random effects ordered logistic regression on panel data from 2017 to 2022 for 2811 companies, we show that companies with long-term investment sources demonstrate a greater interest in measuring environmental variables in their supply chain compared to those financed with short-term investments. Sovereign wealth funds and other long-term investment sources exhibit a positive and significant correlation with higher utilization of ESG indicators in the supply chain.

This research specifically tested how well advanced LLMs like Microsoft Phi 2, Mistral 7B, and Zypher 7B can create practical, risk-aware strategies for investing mutual funds in different sectors of the economy. Our method is sophisticated: it combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which enables the LLM to check external, real-time data with standard financial optimization methods. The model's advice is context-aware because we feed it large economic signals, like changes in the global economy. The Zypher 7B model was the clear winner. It consistently produced strategies that maximized investment returns while delivering better risk-adjusted results than the other models. Its ability to process complex relationships and contextual information makes it a highly powerful tool for financial allocation.

In particular, for short-term horizons, Bitcoin shows favorably low correlation with each index for all years, whereas exception is observed for gold. In addition, diversification between Bitcoin and gold is demonstrated as well, mainly for short-term investments.

Addressing a key gap in the literature, we demonstrate that the price to earnings ratio, as a valuation metric, may probabilistically map return distributions across investment horizons spanning from days to decades. Return profiles exhibit strong asymmetry. One-year returns show a 74 percent probability of gain, with a modal return of 10.67 percent and a reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5. Over long horizons, modal CAGRs surpass 13 percent, while worst-case returns remain negative for up to ten years, defining a historical trapping period. This horizon shortens to six years in the post-1999 period, reflecting growing market resilience. Conditional analysis of the P/E ratio reveals regime-dependent outcomes. Low valuations (P/E less than 13) historically show zero probability of loss across all horizons, while high valuations (P/E greater than 27) correspond to unstable returns and extended breakeven periods. To uncover deeper structure, we apply tools from complexity science. Entropy, Hurst exponents, and Lyapunov indicators reveal weak persistence, long memory, and low-dimensional chaos. Information-theoretic metrics, including mutual information and transfer entropy, confirm a directional and predictive influence of valuation on future returns. These findings offer actionable insights for asset allocation, downside risk management, and long-term investment strategy in emerging markets. Our framework bridges valuation, conditional distributions, and nonlinear dynamics in a rigorous and practically relevant manner.", "citations": 1}

In the tradition of Markowitz, optimal policies are restricted to a subclass of factor exposures in which losses cannot exceed initial capital and it is shown that the optimal policy is characterized by an Euler-Lagrange equation derived by the method of Calculus of Variations. It is a main result, that the Euler-Lagrange equation can be recast into a matrix differential equation by an integral transformation of the factor exposure and that the solution to the characteristic equation can be parametrized by the eigenvalues of the associated lambda-matrix, hence, the optimization problem is equivalent to a spectral problem. Finally, explicit solutions to the optimal policy are provided by application of suitable boundary conditions and it is demonstrated that - if in fact the equity risk-premium is slowly mean-reverting - then investors committing to long investment horizons realize better risk-return trade-offs than investors with shorter investment horizons.", "citations": 0}

The proposed approach extends the usual market-risk measure, ie, Value-at-Risk (VaR) at a short-term horizon and 99% confidence level, by properly applying a scaling on the short-term Profit-and-Loss (P&L) distribution. Besides the standard square-root-of-time scaling, based on normality assumptions, we consider two leptokurtic probability density function classes for fitting empirical P&L datasets and derive accurately their scaling behaviour in light of the Central Limit Theorem, interpreting time scaling as a convolution problem. Our analyses result in a range of possible VaR-scaling approaches depending on the distribution providing the best fit to empirical data, the desired percentile level and the time horizon of the Economic Capital calculation. After assessing the different approaches on a test equity trading portfolio, it emerges that the choice of the VaR-scaling approach can affect substantially the Economic Capital calculation. In particular, the use of a convolution-based approach could lead to significantly larger risk measures (by up to a factor of four) than those calculated using Normal assumptions on the P&L distribution.", "citations": 5}

Results: The politically connected Tunisian companies have a positive and significant impact on the investment horizon and encourage long-term investment. This relationship was confirmed during this period, which was marked by serious events such as the health crisis and political unrest.

For firms listed on the KSE over the period of 2011\u20132019, the analysis findings show that the high stock crash risk attributable to the high sentiment is attenuated for firms with high foreign ownership. However, such moderating effect of foreign ownership disappears when taking foreign investment horizon into consideration. This implies that future stock crash risk reduction under the high sentiment is due to the corporate monitoring role of foreign investors, who are targeting a long-term investment horizon.

To quantify horizon risk, we introduce h-longevity as an indicator. We investigate these notions together with other properties of risk measures as normalization, restriction property, and different formulations of time-consistency. We also consider these concepts for fully-dynamic risk measures generated by backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), and families of these.

Bouchaud", "url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:276575705", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to\"digest\"them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a\"double\"square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.", "citations": 4}

The stock market is volatile and, although it is consolidated, it follows different trends at different times. Therefore, stock market processes are viewed as multitrend in nature. It particularly applies to the process of generating returns. For the convenience of the analysis, a multitrend process can be presented as a finite decomposition using adaptation principles. As we have already said, adaptive mechanisms are an important factor for the effectiveness of the stock market. Considering these requirements, the most suitable method is adaptive trend decomposition. In our study, we used data analysis and machine learning methods. The article presents a method of portfolio analysis based on the decomposition of efficient sets into temporal components. This allows for a comparative analysis of portfolio sets regarding their efficiency over different time intervals and enables a dynamic analysis of the temporal structure of efficient sets in order to determine the optimal time for holding the portfolio or changing its structure. A family of efficient sets provides a better understanding of investment opportunities. Our calculations also demonstrated that the temporal structure of a family of efficient sets is more likely to remain robust during the prediction period.", "citations": 1}

This measures how well (or how bad) the asset performs over that given period of time. It has been established that the distribution of returns exhibits \u201cfat tails\u201d indicating that large returns occur more frequently than what is expected from standard Gaussian stochastic processes [1-3]. Instead of estimating this \u201cfat tail\u201d distribution of returns, we propose here an alternative approach, which is outlined by addressing the following question: What is the smallest time interval needed for an asset to cross a fixed return level of say 10%? For a particular asset, we refer to this time as the investment horizon and the corresponding distribution as the investment horizon distribution. This latter distribution complements that of returns and provides new and possibly crucial information for portfolio design and risk-management, as well as for pricing of more exotic options. By considering historical financial data, exemplified by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we obtain a novel set of probability distributions for the investment horizons which can be used to estimate the optimal investment horizon for a stock or a future contract.", "citations": 84}

As sustainability considerations increasingly influence investment decisions, corporations are compelled to integrate ESG factors into their reporting practices. The primary objective of this research is to comprehensively analyze existing literature, elucidating the patterns, trends, and key insights surrounding ESG disclosures and their repercussions on financial outcomes. The study employs a systematic approach to identify, evaluate, and synthesize pertinent research articles, academic papers, and industry reports. It explores the multifaceted dimensions of ESG disclosures, encompassing environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and governance practices. The analysis spans diverse sectors, examining how ESG reporting has become a crucial component of corporate transparency and stakeholder engagement. The review aims to distill overarching themes from the literature, providing a nuanced understanding of the relationship between ESG disclosures and financials. Preliminary findings suggest that ESG disclosures are positively associated with enhanced financial performance, fostering long-term value creation for firms. However, variations exist in the significance of these relationships across industries and regions. Furthermore, the review highlights the emergence of standardized frameworks and reporting guidelines as essential catalysts for advancing ESG disclosure practices. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable finance by consolidating diverse perspectives and methodologies found in the literature. The synthesis of existing knowledge seeks to inform future research directions, guide corporate practices, and assist policymakers in shaping frameworks that promote responsible and transparent business conduct.

One of the biggest mistakes investors make is not aligning the timeline of their goals with their investment portfolio. In other words, time horizons determine the investment portfolio you should construct. We examine which portfolios are the best for long-term investing, short-term investing, and intraday trading. This study presents a novel approach for portfolio construction based on Network Science. We use daily returns of stocks that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) for a 25-year period from 1998 to 2022. Stock networks are estimated from (i) Pearson correlation (undirected linear statistical correlations), as well as (ii) Transfer Entropy (directed non-linear causal relationships). Portfolios are constructed in two main ways: (a) only four stocks are selected, depending on their centrality, with Markowitz investing weights, or (b) all stocks are selected with centrality-based investing weights. Portfolio performance is evaluated in terms of the following indicators: return, risk (total and systematic), and risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio and Treynor ratio). Results are compared against two benchmarks: the index DJIA, and the Markowitz portfolio based on Modern Portfolio Theory. The key findings are as follows: (1) Peripheral portfolios of low centrality stocks based on Pearson correlation network are the best in the long-term, achieving an extremely high cumulative return of around 3000% as well as high risk-adjusted return; (2) Markowitz portfolio is the safest in the long-term, while on the contrary, central portfolios of high centrality stocks based on Pearson correlation network are the riskiest; (3) In times of crisis, no portfolio is always the best. However, portfolios based on Transfer Entropy network perform better in most of the crises; (4) Portfolios of all stocks selected with centrality-based investing weights outperform in both short-term investing and intraday trading.

We adopt a dynamic portfolio model, which contrary to conventional static mean-variance models, allows us to study optimal portfolios for different decision horizons. Our baseline model contains two assets, one asset with fluctuating returns and another asset with a constant risk-free return. The asset with fluctuating returns can arise from fossil-fuel based sectors or from clean energy related sectors. We consider different drivers of short-termism: the discount rate, the nature of discounting (exponential vs. hyperbolic), and the decision horizon of investors itself. We study first the implications of these determinants of short-termism on the portfolio wealth dynamics of the baseline model. We find that portfolio wealth declines faster with a higher discount rate, with hyperbolic discounting, and with shorter decision horizon. We extend our model to include a portfolio of two assets with fluctuating returns. For both model variants, we explore the cases where innovation efforts are spent on fossil fuel or clean energy sources. Detailing dynamic portfolio decisions in such a way may allow us for better pathways to empirical tests and may provide guidance to some online financial decision making.", "citations": 13}

To understand decision making in cryptocurrency holders, we assessed temporal discounting, that is, whether Bitcoin holders disregard rewards if they are distant in time and overvalue rewards if they are more immediate. Further, we compared performance between short-term investors (i.e., day-traders) vs. long-term investors. Methods Using an online survey, we invited 144 Bitcoin holders to answer temporal discounting questionnaires dealing with money (\u201cWhich do you prefer, that you get right now 20 USD in cash or 100 USD in a month?\u201d) and Bitcoin (\u201cWhich do you prefer, that you get right now 0.1 or 1 Bitcoin in a month?\u201d). Results Analysis demonstrated no significant differences between temporal discounting for money and Bitcoin. However, and critically, higher temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin was observed in short-term investors compared with long-term investors. In a similar vein, significant positive correlations were observed between day trading and temporal discounting for both money and Bitcoin. Discussion These findings demonstrate how Bitcoin holders with short-term time horizons tend to prioritize immediate rewards over larger but delayed rewards. Future research can assess the neural basis of temporal discounting for cryptocurrencies.", "citations": 3}

In this study, we propose an alternative forecasting approach for financial derivative price multiple days ahead and simulated trading based on long short-term memory (LSTM). This study aims to evaluate for different multiple days ahead forecasting and trading by deep LSTM-based model using technical analytic features, which have nonlinear behaviors. The effectiveness of LSTM networks trained by backpropagation through time for test objective prediction is explored. Moreover, instead of using only one crude oil market's spot price data as a data source, we build up a crude oil database with the two most important crude oil markets. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms others in terms of accuracy, return, and risk aspect. The forecasting and holding (for trade) time horizons are 1\u20133\u2009days ahead, respectively. For all three multiple days ahead forecasting and trading, the average test accuracy (judged by root mean square error) of two crude oil markets for four datasets of deep LSTM-based model yields best results among all methods. This study also developed trading strategies, and the proposed LSTM-based method also outperforms other benchmark methods on both return and return-risk ratio (judged by Sharpe ratio).

Signifying the importance of each feature, we employ the LASSO algorithm to derive an optimal feature combination. Additionally, our methodology utilizes the Ca-LSTM (cascade long short-term memory) technique, enhancing information extraction from individual features. Experimental results, gauged by mean error, underscore the superiority of the Ca-LSTM model over other time series prediction models and conventional long short-term memory approaches.

Empirical results from the multivariate time\u2013frequency correlations show that the comovements of tail risks are distinctively higher during periods of economic and political turmoil in the short term. The multivariate long-term comovements are highly stable and extremely strong which can be taken as evidence of long-term integration. In contrast, the bivariate time\u2013frequency correlations are remarkably weaker in the short term not only during periods of crises but over most of the sample period. The results of the bivariate analysis also highlight the instability of the long-term pairwise correlations of the tail risks, showing that it is susceptible to sudden changes, which indicates that the tail risks of the US and emerging Asian stock markets are actually not completely integrated in the long term.

EMD is designed for multiscale and adaptive time-frequency decomposition in nonstationary time series. EMD-RCR generates multi-time-frequency resolution adaptive forecasting models of predictive covariance forecasts for a universe of selected asset returns. This provides a unique method to obtain predictive covariance regression structures for the short-, mid-, and long-time-scale portfolio dynamics. EMD isolates structures in a frequency-hierarchical fashion (with automated sorting of structures through EMD-MDLP available) which allows this multi-time-frequency covariance forecasting framework that uses the structures isolated using EMD (referred to as IMFs: Intrinsic Mode Functions) as the explanatory variables in the RCR framework. Having developed these techniques, a case study is used for exposition for active portfolio asset management. The case study is based on a dynamic long/short equity and risk premia parity (or risk parity) portfolio-of-portfolios investment strategy using the 11 sectors dividing the 505 stocks of the S&P 500. Each of the 11 sector indices is constructed using a market capitalisation ratio of the companies within the respective sector. The portfolio will be reweighted monthly based on the covariance structure forecast using covariance regression, in which covariance regression factors will be obtained at multiple time-frequency scales endogenously from the ETF asset price returns from each sector. At the end of each month, the covariance is forecast for the next month or investment horizon. This is done using low-, mid-, and high-frequency IMFs isolated using EMD from the 11 sector indices over the previous year. The IMFs isolated from the 11 sector indices over the previous year are fitted against the daily logarithmic returns in the RCR model to make multi-frequency covariance forecasts. We construct long/short equity and risk premia parity portfolios using each different covariance forecast and review the results. The performance of the portfolios will be measured using multiple performance measures (the most relevant being risk-related measures with risk premia parity in focus) and contrasted against multiple benchmark portfolios using several well-known portfolio optimisation techniques such as PCA and multivariate GARCH extensions.

Consequently, this study examines the time\u2013frequency co-movement of multi-asset classes in South Africa by using the Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic\u2013Asymmetrical Dynamic Conditional Correlation (MGARCH-DCC) model, Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation (MODWT), and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (WTC) for the period 2007 to 2024. The findings demonstrate that the equity\u2013bond, equity\u2013property, equity\u2013gold, bond\u2013property, bond\u2013gold, and property\u2013gold markets depict asymmetrical time-varying correlations. Moreover, correlation in these asset pairs varies at investment periods (short-term, medium-term, and long-term), with historical events such as the 2007/2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic causing these asset pairs to co-move at different investment periods, which reduces diversification properties. The findings suggest that South African multi-asset markets co-move, affecting the diversification properties of holding multi-asset classes in a portfolio at different investment periods. Consequently, investors should consider the holding periods of each asset market pair in a portfolio as they dictate the level of portfolio diversification. Investors should also remember that there are lead\u2013lag relationships and risk transmission between asset market pairs, enhancing portfolio volatility.

Using a dataset of 30 publicly traded U.S. stocks spanning diverse sectors, the MoE approach consistently outperforms both standalone models. Specifically, it achieves up to 33% improvement in MSE for volatile assets and 28% for stable assets relative to their respective baselines. Stratified evaluation across volatility classes demonstrates the model's ability to adapt complexity to underlying market dynamics.

The MSCI ACWI Sustainable Impact, MSCI World EGS, and carbon efficient indices except for S&P 500 CEI exhibit weak hedge or safe-haven attributes. Wavelet coherence reveals negative (positive) co-movements between the thematic and carbon efficient indices in short-term (medium-term and long-term) horizons with consistent leading behavior of thematic indices to carbon efficient indices outcomes. It justifies the presence of short-lived hedging or safe-haven characteristics in the thematic domain for investors. These strong and weak hedge or safe-haven characteristics of low carbon and sustainability indices reveal that adding low carbon efficient and sustainable investments to a portfolio result in considerable diversification benefits for investors who tend to take minimal risk in both tranquil and tumultuous periods. The current findings imply that financial institutions, thematic investing companies, and governments need to encourage carbon efficient technology transfer and innovation-themed investments by increasing the fund allocations in underlying asset classes. Policy-making and regulatory bodies can encourage investors to make carbon-efficient and thematic investments and companies to issue carbon-efficient stocks or investments to safeguard social and economic risks during fragile periods. These investments can offer greater opportunities to combat the intensity of economic shocks on portfolios for responsible or sustainable investors.", "citations": 3}

Portfolios with a specific distribution of fixed-income and equity securities were randomly replicated and their performance was studied over different time horizons. Daily data from 2004 to 2021 was used. Since the sum of all asset weights invariably equals the unit, the original data were transformed using the compositional data methodology.

In this study, I apply TimeMixer, a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model, to predict the volatility of global financial assets. TimeMixer utilizes a multiscale-mixing approach that effectively captures both short-term and long-term temporal patterns by analyzing data across different scales. My empirical results reveal that while TimeMixer performs exceptionally well in short-term volatility forecasting, its accuracy diminishes for longer-term predictions, particularly in highly volatile markets. These findings highlight TimeMixer's strength in capturing short-term volatility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in financial risk management, where precise short-term forecasts are critical.

There is an increasing need for a fast, cost-effective, and comprehensive method to evaluate the performance and detect and compare many companies' strategy changes efficiently. We propose a novel data-driven approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically analyze and rate the performance of companies based on their SEC 10-K filings. These filings, which provide detailed annual reports on a company's financial performance and strategic direction, serve as a rich source of data for evaluating various aspects of corporate health, including confidence, environmental sustainability, innovation, and workforce management. We also introduce an automated system for extracting and preprocessing 10-K filings. This system accurately identifies and segments the required sections as outlined by the SEC, while also isolating key textual content that contains critical information about the company. This curated data is then fed into Cohere's Command-R+ LLM to generate quantitative ratings across various performance metrics. These ratings are subsequently processed and visualized to provide actionable insights. The proposed scheme is then implemented on an interactive GUI as a no-code solution for running the data pipeline and creating the visualizations. The application showcases the rating results and provides year-on-year comparisons of company performance.", "citations": 2}

The empirical findings demonstrate a strong correlation between these GCC sukuk bond indices and shariah stock indices. The degree of connectedness between these sukuk and shariah stock indices varies across time and scale. A strong and positive association is observed in the short term and a negative association is evident in the long term. The same findings are observed, using the wavelet cohesion approach that also validates the existence of portfolio diversification opportunities at a short-time horizon.

A number of empirical studies have documented a phenomenon referred to as the \u2018forward premium puzzle\u2019, which states that the carry trade is profitable on average. However, the carry reversal during the 2008 global crisis periods wiped out the profits earned by the trade. To account for the regime shifts in the joint distribution of returns on the carry trade with FX market portfolios, we adopt a Markov regime switching model. We find evidence of two economic regimes: one state captures periods of the forward premium puzzle and UIP being violated, whilst the other reports high FX volatility and negative return of carry trade portfolio. Furthermore, to quantify the economic significance of regimes in returns on currency portfolios, we consider their importance in investors\u2019 optimal portfolio allocation problem. We find strong evidence that optimal currency portfolio holdings vary significantly across regimes and across short and long investment horizons, as investors anticipate a shift out of the current state. Our results also show that the regimes partially anticipate peso events as well as the changes of funding liquidity measured by the TED spreads. A strategy that accounts for regimes, thus, generates overall stronger performance than the single-state Gaussian IID model, a carry trade procedure as well as a buy-and-hold strategy.", "citations": 3}

Daily stock index data were acquired from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database during a ten-year period, from January 2011 to December 2020. The main contribution of this work is determining whether these markets are efficient (as defined by the EMH), in which case the appropriate stock indexes dynamic equation is the GBM, or fractal (as described by the FMH), in which case the appropriate stock indexes dynamic equation is the GFBM. In this paper, we consider two methods for calculating the Hurst exponent: the rescaled range method (RS) and the periodogram method (PE). To determine which of the dynamics (GBM, GFBM) is more appropriate, we employed the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) method. The simulation results demonstrate that the GFBM is better suited for forecasting stock market indexes than the GBM when the analyzed markets display fractality.

We study the heterogeneous model theoretically and empirically to highlight essential mechanisms underlying certain market behaviours, such as transitions between bull and bear markets and the self-similar behaviour of price changes. Most importantly, we apply this model to show that the stock market is nearly efficient on intraday timescales, adjusting quickly to incoming news, but becomes inefficient on longer timescales, where news may have a long-lasting nonlinear impact on dynamics, attributable to a feedback mechanism acting over these horizons. Then, using the model, we design algorithmic strategies that utilize news flow, quantified and measured, as the only input to trade on market return forecasts over multiple horizons, from days to months. The backtested results suggest that the return is predictable to the extent that successful trading strategies can be constructed to harness this predictability.", "citations": 15}

This study is aimed at investors (individual and institutional) and fund industry regulators, highlighting the importance of past performance presentation. This article aims to contribute to the area by investigating how investors are influenced by varying perceptions of risk and return on fixed-income and variable-income assets, depending on information presentation format. The approach used is based on a 2x2 factorial quasi-experiment, in which format (within-subject) and time horizon (between-subjects) effects are tested in a sample of 143 respondents. Our results indicate that, for investment in a variable-income fund, a monthly yield presentation format leads to higher perceived risk, and that a framing emphasizing fund value evolution leads to higher perceived returns. As for investment in a fixed-income fund, the framing that emphasizes fund value leads to both higher perceived risk and higher perceived returns. When comparing the results for the two types of investments, the risk perception was higher for variable-income than for fixed income funds. However, perceived returns were higher for fixed income than for variable-income funds due to the framing effect, although realized returns do not corroborate this perception.", "citations": 4}

In the case of large orders, the problem becomes even more complex as the impact of the order in the market has to be taken into account. The usual solution is to split large orders into a set of smaller suborders that must be executed within a prescribed time window. This leads to the problem of deciding when in the time window execute each suborder. There are popular ways of executing the trading of these split orders like those which try to track the \u201cTime Weighted Average Price\u201d and the \u201cVolume Weighted Average Price\u201d, usually called TWAP and VWAP orders. This paper presents a strategy to optimize the splitting of large trade orders over a given time window. The strategy is based on the solution of an optimization problem that is applied following a receding horizon approach. This approach reduces the impact of prediction errors due to the uncertain market dynamics, by using new values of the price time series as they are available as time goes on. Suborder size constraints are taken into account in both market and limit orders. The strategy relies on price and traded volume forecast but it is independent of the prediction technique used. The performance index weighs not only the financial cost of the suborders, but also the impact on the market and the forecasting accuracy. A tailored optimization algorithm is proposed for efficiently solving the corresponding optimization problem. Most of the computations of the algorithm can be parallelized. Finally, the proposed approach has been tested through a case study composed by stocks of the Chinese A-share market.", "citations": 5}

Inspired by an analogy between price dynamics and hydrodynamic turbulence, it models the time scale dependence of the probability distribution of returns in terms of a superposition of Gaussian laws, with a log-normal distribution of the Gaussian variances. This multifractal description of asset fluctuations is generalized into a multivariate framework to account simultaneously for correlations across time scales and between a basket of assets. The reported empirical results show that this extension is pertinent for financial modelling. Two sources of departure from normality are discussed: at large time scales, the distinction between discretely and continuously discounted returns leads to the usual log-normal deviation from normality; at small time scales, the multiplicative cascade process leads to multifractality and strong deviations from normality. By perturbation expansions of the cumulants of the distribution of returns, we are able to quantify precisely the interplay and crossover between these two mechanisms. The second part of the paper applies this theory to portfolio optimization. Our multiscale description allows us to characterize the portfolio return distribution at all time scales simultaneously. The portfolio composition is predicted to change with the investment time horizon (i.e. the time scale) in a way that can be fully determined once an adequate measure of risk is chosen. We discuss the use of the fourth-order cumulant and of utility functions. While the portfolio volatility can be optimized in some cases for all time horizons, the kurtosis and higher normalized cumulants cannot be simultaneously optimized. For a fixed investment horizon, we study in detail the influence of the number of rebalancing of the portfolio. For the large risks quantified by the cumulants of order larger than two, the number of periods has a non-trivial influence, in contrast with Tobin's result valid in the mean-variance framework. This theory provides a fundamental framework for the conflicting optimization involved in the different time horizons and quantifies systematically the trade-offs for an optimal inter-temporal portfolio optimization.", "citations": 118}

Long-run returns are also calculated for the first 6, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0months of trading and for the entire history of ETFs up to October 31, 2016 from a cumulative and a buy-and-hold perspective. Risk-adjusted returns are estimated with a six-factor model. The results indicate that the average first-day return is positive but below 1%. In the long run, the cumulative absolute returns are positive during the several intervals examined, whereas the cumulative benchmark-adjusted and abnormal returns are positive only for the first 6\u00a0months of trading. These returns become negative after the first 6\u00a0months. Going further, ETFs deliver significant buy-and-hold returns over the several periods examined. Finally, the results reveal that just one out of the four IPO ETFs examined can produce a robust and statistically significant alpha.", "citations": 0}

The long-term is defined, for the purposes of this paper, as the 3-year time period, traded usually with daily, weekly and monthly time-frames. Trading is a temporal (i.e. time-based) historical living system with a number of functions, like: SEO, IPO, stock (instrument) price action Gaps, Breakouts, etc. In this domain, a number of warning long-term and short-term dynamics timing functionalities is available, like: candlestick patterns breaks, price action patterns pivotal-lines breaks, on open gup-ups (ooGUp), on open gup-downs (ooGDn), morning breakouts (mB), etc. All these time-based functionalities are regarded as 2nd level functions (i.e. functions of functions; because of the timing involved) with great trading opportunities, and they are defined \u00a8Cfor the first time in the corporate finance literature- by this paper as temporal (timing) trading functionalities. In particular, the SEOs with the embedded long-term TTF functionalities are great trading opportunities for the institutions, the individual (non-commercial) market investors, the swing traders, and the speculators. Data analysis shows that during the seasoned equity offerings time, shareowners significantly increase their share-holding, including offerings that would be classified as overpriced at that time; hence, the involved trading volatility is increased resulting in great trading and profit opportunities. This paper contributes to corporate finance literature by examining the SEOs functions and define and document their inherit TTF functionalities. For this purpose, four categories of share-holders are regarded: The long-term institution & non-commercial traders (investors), the swing momentary institution traders (institutions), the short-term non-commercial traders (speculators) and the intraday non-commercial traders (speculators). Paper concludes that, in SEO/long-term TTF trading, apart from the insiders, the swing traders (usually the smart-money and the institutions) are more benefited, at the expense of momentary short-term and intraday speculators, while the long-term investors are not affected by the SEO offerings.", "citations": 7}

An analysis grounded on this framework allows one to capture information from a different dimension, as opposed to the traditional time domain analyses, where multiscale structures of financial markets are clearly extracted. In financial time series, multiscale features manifest themselves due to presence of multiple time horizons. The existence of multiple time horizons necessitates a careful investigation of each time horizon separately as market structures are not homogenous across different time horizons. The presence of multiple time horizons, with varying levels of complexity, requires one to investigate financial time series from a heterogeneous market perspective where market players are said to operate at different investment horizons. This thesis extends the application of time-frequency based wavelet techniques to: i) analyse the interdependence of global equity markets from a heterogeneous investor perspective with a special focus on the Indian stock market, ii) investigate the contagion effect, if any, of financial crises on Indian stock market, and iii) to study fractality and scaling properties of global equity markets and analyse the efficiency of Indian stock markets using wavelet based long memory methods.", "citations": 0}

Iacob, Drago\u0219-Alexandru Ha\u0219egan", "url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:229544105", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "In this article, the authors focused on creating a model for analyzing assets and decisions that can be taken in studying and forecasting the capital market under the impact of inflation. The prices of the capital market can be established on the basis of the normal evolution of deflated prices or based on a study regarding the previous stage and evolution of the capital market. In the capital market, prices can be expressed at market developments or, at other times, at prices without arbitrage. The intertemporal accumulation model of assets is clearly under the influence of capital risk. Therefore, the dynamics of the price evolution rate must play an important role, but this can only be done in close correlation with the dynamics of the inflation rate. Many hypotheses can be considered that happen in the short, medium or long term, in the evolution of prices on the capital market. We say the evolution of prices because, according to this, they coordinate, correlate the investors' intentions to place the capital market assets, to station or to restrict them. From this point of view, any analysis of the forecast, the forecast of the capital market must be done in close accordance with the concrete analysis of the dynamics of inflation. Inflation, in its dynamics, also helps to establish prices on the capital market and, consequently, the returns obtained on the capital market. The market prices are those that determine the returns that can be obtained by investors who place their assets on the capital market. The evolution of prices on the capital market and the evolution of the perspective of capital prices must be closely observed in line with the dynamics of the inflation rate. By assigning assets under risk aversion, it is clear that it is the parameter that highlights the effect and direction in which the investments in the capital market develop. Consequently, we can specify that the dynamics of inflation over a period of time in which the assets are placed is what determines the size of the respective returns. Without a correct estimate of inflation, a certain forecast cannot be made regarding the evolution of the price and, consequently, of the evolution of the returns that happen on the capital market. The dynamics of inflation, determined by statistical-econometric methods, ensure the possibility of the capital market reacting positively or not. Inflation needs to be updated through forecast studies and then used to deflate capital market indicators so that deflated indicators can suggest the forecast of the capital market evolution. In other ideas, we can specify that, the estimation of prices by arbitrary way, as well as the correlative study between the evolution of the activity in the capital markets and the yields that will be obtained are in close agreement. The study also aims at forecasting the capital market in the short, medium and long term, depending on the evolution of prices, the dynamics of inflation during the forecast period.", "citations": 1}

During global crises, extreme price declines and heightened selling pressure often prompt long-term investors to shift their focus toward short-term investments. These sudden shifts significantly increase the prevalence of short-term investment horizons. As a result, market participants become more homogeneous, and this behavior induces strong dependencies in both the return and volatility series of the crude oil market.\u00a0 This study employs rescaled range analysis, aggregated variance methods, and the periodogram method to capture the long memory and informational efficiency dynamics of the WTI market.

Zheng, Lei Tan", "url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:2669383", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "Background For complex financial systems, the negative and positive return-volatility correlations, i.e., the so-called leverage and anti-leverage effects, are particularly important for the understanding of the price dynamics. However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and anti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects in agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing microscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters from empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results. Methods To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility correlation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and collective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based model. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and particularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors\u2019 asymmetric trading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we propose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from historical market data. Results With the model parameters determined for six representative stock-market indices in the world, respectively, we obtain the corresponding leverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in agreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time, our model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail distribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities. Conclusions We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both the investors\u2019 asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation mechanisms. Among the six markets, however, the investors\u2019 trading is approximately symmetric for the five markets which exhibit the leverage effect, thus contributing very little. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the determination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems with similar asymmetries.", "citations": 58}

Highlights from our results indicate the following: First, almost a perfect market integration at long-run periods for the REIT markets is observed. However, such strong market correlations dissipate significantly to moderate and weaker linkages at the medium, and short-run periods, thereby showing possible diversification opportunities at the latter scales. The finding also signifies that global REITs linkages increases with investment horizons. Second, an interdependent global market is found, where well-developed REITs tend to lead/lag relatively smaller or less developed market (especially Africa\u2019s REIT) across scales.

Using a \u2018market discount factor\u2019 estimated for publicly traded firms based on a capital asset pricing model, we show that US capital markets have become increasingly short-term oriented over the past thirty years. We corroborate this finding by estimating the impact of various investment behaviors and relevant ownership variables on our measure of short-termism, market discounting. We find that markets more heavily discount firms that have less financial slack, spend less on capital or R&D, or have greater analyst coverage. Consistent with prior research, we also find that public firms held by more transient institutional investors (i.e., investors that have significant turnovers of stocks) are more heavily discounted than their counterparts held by dedicated investors (i.e., investors that hold stocks for the long term). Further, firms that pay their executives proportionately more via long-term compensation packages are discounted less than firms with more short-term compensation. To examine the impact of short-term valuation on firm behavior, we also estimate the impact of short-termism on capital spending using changes in a firm\u2019s institutional ownership type (e.g., a switch from transient to dedicated or vice versa) as an identification mechanism. We find that short-term market valuations are significantly negatively correlated with future capital investment. Overall, these results suggest that market discounting may proxy for firm short-termism. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to demonstrate economy-wide, firm-level evidence of increasing short-termism and the implications for investment behaviors by firms.", "citations": 37}

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers new opportunities for modeling trading decisions, while traditional portfolio optimization and rule-based techniques remain popular. The relative strengths of benchmarks, rule-based filters, and RL models across investment horizons remain underexplored. This study fills the gap by comparing nine different strategies using daily data from 2,889 NASDAQ-listed stocks obtained from stockanalysis.com. Simulations were implemented in R (data preparation) and Python (modeling and RL algorithms). All agents started with 10,000 USD and were evaluated over three horizons: short-term (1 week), medium-term (1 month), and long-term (~160 trading days). The strategies included two benchmarks (Random Agent, Equal-Weight), two rule-based methods (Volatility-Momentum-Leadership, Mean-Reversion), three tabular RL models (Q-Learning, Safe Q-Learning, SARSA), and two deep RL algorithms (DQN, A2C).The findings show that the Volatility-Momentum-Leadership (VML) strategy achieved the best long-term performance, tripling the portfolio to 31,845. The Safe Q-Learning variant produced a more modest 25.2% gain, while the Mean-Reversion strategy collapsed under transaction costs. Deep RL models (e.g., DQN) performed well in the short term but declined over time. Nevertheless, rule-based filters delivered more consistent growth in the short horizon (1). The results also suggest that (2) RL shows promise mainly over short-horizon tactical trading but requires refinement for long-term stability, and (3) transaction costs are critical for strategy viability. This study contributes to portfolio optimization by showing that explainable rules provide robust baselines, while reinforcement learning may enhance timing and adaptability in practice.", "citations": 0}

We derive the time-consistent strategy for the proposed model with and without a risk-free asset by using the backward induction approach. The results show that, in the case that there exists a risk-free asset, the time-consistent strategy is a feedback strategy about the benchmark process. However, in the other case, the time-consistent strategy is a double feedback strategy on both the benchmark process and the wealth process. Finally, we carry out some numerical simulations to show the evolution process of the time-consistent strategy. These simulations indicate that the proposed strategy can not only reduce the risk of investment existed in the intermediate time period but also imitate the return of the benchmark process.", "citations": 3}

In comparison, the European carbon market stands as the most mature and well-developed carbon market globally. Carbon trading prices, serving as a barometer for the carbon market, are significantly influenced by investor behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of carbon trading prices in both China and Europe, considering the impact of investor trading intervals and psychological expected returns. This study utilizes the Zipf method to characterize the dynamic behavior of carbon trading prices between China and Europe, conducting a comparative analysis. The results show distinctive asymmetry in the behavior of carbon trading prices in both markets. In the Chinese market, when \u03c4 < 277, the absolute deviation da(\u03c4, \u03b5) value gradually changes but consistently indicates a bullish trend. However, when \u03c4 \u2265 277, the da(\u03c4, \u03b5) value surges rapidly, reflecting a pronounced bullish sentiment among investors toward carbon trading prices in China. In the European market, within the sample period, regardless of variations in \u03c4 and \u03b5, the da(\u03c4, \u03b5) value shows a linear upward trend, indicating a significant overall bullishness in prices. This suggests a higher probability of long-term bullishness in carbon trading prices. Investors\u2019 investment time scale (\u03c4) and expected returns (\u03b5) both influence the behavior of carbon trading prices in both China and Europe. Generally, a longer \u03c4 implies a higher probability of bullishness. As for \u03b5, higher values lead to more extreme judgments on price movements, resulting in greater distortion in carbon trading prices. Short-term investors (\u03c4<1 month) anticipate extreme fluctuations, exhibiting random behavior when \u03b5 < 0.15 and converging rapidly to extreme values of 1 or 0 when \u03b5 \u2265 0.15. Long-term investors (\u03c4>quarter) are less biased, expressing a bullish outlook on both Chinese and European carbon prices. With increasing \u03b5, the probability of bullishness either increases or decreases rapidly until reaching the saturation point. Once saturated, there is no further distortion in carbon price behavior. Furthermore, the Chinese carbon market displays a positive trend in carbon trading prices and a higher probability of long-term bullishness. For the European market, lower expected returns contribute to considerable carbon trading price fluctuations, exacerbating risk and uncertainty. The results of this study contribute to understanding the diverse trading behaviors in Chinese and European carbon markets and provide guidance for avoiding extreme volatility in carbon trading prices.", "citations": 2}

This information could be fundamental for practitioners as the past performance can be affected by the non-stationarity of financial market. In order to highlight this feature, we introduce the 'local risk decomposition' (LRD) formalism, where dynamical information about a strategy's performance is retained. This framework, motivated by the multi-scaling techniques used in complex system theory, is particularly suitable for high-frequency trading systems and can be applied into problems of strategy optimization.", "citations": 0}

Liquidity is defined as the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash. A considerable number of studies investigated stock liquidity providing evidence that more illiquid stocks yield higher returns which include an illiquidity premium. According to Amihuda and Mendelson (1986b: 43\u201348), a required rate of return on the shares (gross, i.e. after taking into account the cost of liquidity) should increase with increasing liquidity, but the marginal increase should decrease with an increasing investment horizon, thus decreasing the likelihood of premature termination of the investment. As a result, investors with different investment horizons may require different rates of return per unit of time from the same shares (Huang 2003: 104\u2013129). Investor horizon is the time period for which an investor holds a stock. Most of the research conducted on investment horizon links it to liquidity, supporting the thesis that it is negatively related to liquidity. \u201cTransaction costs and the holding periods for common stocks\u201d written by Atkins and Dyl (1997: 309\u2013325) is one of the first papers to investigate the effects of liquidity on holding period. The aim of this study is to show the dependencies occurring between the phenomena of investment horizon and asymmetric information and the liquidity of shares of a company.", "citations": 2}

Actually, we consider the interaction between the social performance (for environment, employment and community activities) and the financial and trading performance than would be the case for an accumulated functionality in NFP releases. In general, social performance returns are negatively related to trading returns; so, the relatively poor financial and market trading reward (profit), offered by socially responsible ethical ETFs trading the NFP reports, is in accordance to their good social performance regarding employment and environmental aspects. This could be changed if these ethical ETFs incorporate into their arsenal of trading tools a number of CSR.mtv functions (utilities) discussed in this article.

Our research goals are, first, to study what consequences the introduction of heterogeneous investment horizons has for agent-based financial market models, and second, how effective transaction taxes are in stabilizing financial markets. Numerical simulations reveal that under sufficiently small tax rates traders abstain from short-term trading in favour of longer investment horizons. This change in behavior leads to less volatility and less mispricings. When the tax rate exceeds a certain threshold, however, mispricings increase as also found in Westerhoff (Heterogeneous Traders and the Tobin Tax and The Use of Agent-Based Financial Market Models to Test the Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies). This emergent property is due to the fact that taxation reduces short-term fluctuations and causes longer lasting trends in the exchange rate. As a result, the longer term fundamentalist trading rule becomes unpopular in favor of the longer term trend-chasing rule.", "citations": 25}

In order to explore the impact of international oil price fluctuation on China\u2019s stock markets and the time-varying spillover differences of industry sectors, this study proposes three research hypotheses and constructs a multi-time scale analysis framework based on wavelet analysis and a time-varying t-Copula model. In this paper, we use the Shanghai Composite Index as the representative of a general trend of the stock market, and we use the stock index of the China Securities Industry as the counterpart of industrial sectors. Based on the data from 5 January 2005 to 31 May 2020, this paper measures and analyzes the spillover effect of international oil price fluctuation on China\u2019s stock markets, under different volatility periods. The results show that, firstly, the spillover effect of international oil price fluctuation on the Chinese stock markets is different. In the short and medium volatility period, the changes in international oil price are ahead of the changes in the Chinese stock markets, while the latter is ahead of the former under long-term fluctuations. Secondly, the spillover effect of international oil price fluctuation on China\u2019s industry stock indexes is persistent. As the time scale increases, the tail dependency will increase. Finally, the impact of risk events aggravates the volatility of the stock markets in the short-term, while the mid- to long-term impact mainly affects the volatility trend.

Little attention has been paid to investigating the relationship between trading volume and various stock indices. Approach: Since stock indices track overall stock market movements, trends in trading volume could be used t o forecast future stock market trends. Instead of focusing only on individual stocks, this study will examine movements in major stock markets as a whole. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between trading volume and five popular stock indices using daily data from January , 2000 to June, 2010. A lag of 5 days was used because this represents the prior week of trading v olume. The total sample size ranges from 1,534- 2,638 to observations. Smaller samples were used to test the investment horizon that explains movements of the indices more completely. Results: The F statistics were significant for samples using 6 and 16 months of data. The F statistic was not significant using a sample of 1 month of data. This is surprising given the short term focus of te chnical analysis. The results indicate that above- average returns can be achieved using futures, opti ons and exchange traded funds which track these indices. Conclusion: Future research efforts will include out-of-sample forecasting to determine if above-average returns can be achieved. Additional r esearch can be conducted to determine the optimal number of lags for each index.", "citations": 19}

We also provide several illustrative analogies that are meant to intuitively explain the pleasures and the pitfalls that can arise while managing a portfolio.If we consider the entire investment management procedure as being akin to connecting the dots of a circle, then the Circle of Investment can be represented as a dotted circle with many dots falling approximately on the circumference and with no clue about the exact location of the centre or the length of the radius.We represent the investment process as a dotted circle since there is a lot of ambiguity in the various steps involved. The circle also indicates the repetitive nature of many steps that are continuously carried out while investing.While there are numerous methods that can be applied to each step of the process, we mention the ones that are most used in practice and highlight the elements that a practitioner needs to watch out for. In the beginning, we consider the idea of market efficiency and equilibrium and the lack of both, though we find that there is a tendency to move towards efficiency and the establishment of states of pseudo-equilibrium. This leads to the realization that any hypothesis comes with limitations and that investments are constantly under the shadow of this uncertainty.This work introduces two new points pertaining to this dotted circle and improves the ability; to understand how far-off this dotted circle is, from a more well-defined circle and; to create a well-formed circle. One point lies close to the centre of the circle and helps clarify both the size and shape of the circle. The other point lies on the periphery of the circle and helps with forming a more round shape.The two innovations we introduce regarding the investment life-cycle are: 1. The first, relating to the limitations that apply to any finding in the social sciences, would be the additional point we introduce that lies near the centre of the circle. We title this as, \u201cThe Uncertainty Principle of the Social Sciences\u201d.2. The second, relating to establishing confidence levels in a systematic manner for each view we associate with a security or group of securities as required by the Black Litterman framework, would be the new point we present near the circumference of the circle.We restrict ourselves primarily to the equity asset class, while clarifying earlier on that the main differences between asset classes are simply due to the contractual terms and the number of parties involved in the transfer of wealth. In addition to equities, we look at the execution costs that apply to foreign exchange, fixed income and commodities. This is important since some equity portfolios could be across different markets and hence have currency exposure; or the portfolio could hold high grade fixed income instruments, in lieu of holding cash; or there might be the occasional active bet on commodities to increase the return or as a diversification measure.", "citations": 17}

In this paper, an empirical sensitivity analysis of two well-known portfolio selection models is performed for the first time with respect to both the learning and the holding period. In particular , we investigate the outcomes of the Mean-Variance model and of 4982 the Mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk model with respect to the length of learning and holding periods for different risk strategies and different rolling time-windows.

This paper investigates the integration of AI technologies within ESG investment strategies, elucidating their profound impact on decision-making processes and financial outcomes. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms, AI empowers investors to analyze extensive ESG-related datasets, extract actionable insights, and identify investment opportunities aligned with sustainability objectives. The application of AI-driven ESG analysis enables investors to construct well-structured portfolios that not only aim for financial success but also adhere to ethical and sustainable principles. Through the utilization of AI, investors can systematically evaluate the environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance practices of potential investments. This approach facilitates the identification of ESG risks and opportunities with greater precision and efficiency, leading to more informed investment decisions. Moreover, AI enables investors to dynamically adjust their portfolios in response to changing market conditions and emerging sustainability trends. By continuously monitoring ESG factors and leveraging predictive analytics, investors can proactively manage risks and seize opportunities to enhance portfolio performance over the long term. This proactive approach not only mitigates potential ESG-related risks but also positions investors to capitalize on emerging market trends and shifts in consumer preferences. Furthermore, the integration of AI in ESG investing fosters transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement within the investment ecosystem. AI-powered tools facilitate the dissemination of ESG-related information, enabling investors to make informed decisions that align with their values and sustainability goals. By harnessing the capabilities of AI, investors can drive positive environmental and social impact while achieving competitive financial returns. In conclusion, the utilization of AI in ESG investing represents a paradigm shift in portfolio management, offering investors unprecedented opportunities to navigate complex ESG challenges and achieve sustainable financial success.", "citations": 26}

To address the challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to 2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility. Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable, auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.", "citations": 0}
